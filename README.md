# summer2025-ai-robotics-track

This repo documents my focused summer learning journey in AI and robotics. I'm not following a course â€” Iâ€™m designing, experimenting, and building small systems to sharpen my skills in machine learning, computer vision, and autonomous control.

## ðŸ§  Why This Exists

Theory is easy to collect. Implementation is where the gaps show.  
This repo is where I close those gaps â€” through code.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### `ai-sports-tracker/`  
Basic object detection pipeline using OpenCV and Python. This project builds from raw video frames to object tracking â€” no pretrained models at first. Later stages may include integrating YOLOv8, motion tracking, and prediction logic.

Skills targeted:
- OpenCV basics (frame reading, drawing, masking)
- Video processing
- Contour detection and filtering
- Object tracking logic
- (Later: Deep learning model integration)

### `robotics-sim/` *(Coming Soon)*  
A simplified robot simulator with either PyBullet or Arduino/physical components. Will include PID control, path planning, and possibly sensor feedback.
